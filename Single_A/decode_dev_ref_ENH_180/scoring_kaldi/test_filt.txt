P05_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0530206-0530822 um but now we're closer to it well maybe equidistant from from texas 
P05_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0531092-0531218 cuz we're more west 
P05_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0531406-0532002 texas you normally have to fly to denver and then a small flight from denver to jackson hole 
P05_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0532114-0533016 i'd say it's two and half hour flight to three no maybe three to well i guess with the extra flight it's longer

P05_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0696277-0698061 hmm this one i moved the table and i put the bike here in front of the fan and i paused the fan and i was like you know what if i'm going to sit here and be searching facebook or reading an article why not do it while riding the bike so abhi was cooking for an hour and i'm just sitting there on a oh 
P05_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0698153-0698749 yeah you can change the resistance you can get the calories you can get your heartbeat um 
P05_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0699033-0699143 i know 
P05_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0699381-0700145 yes there was a hill which like you don't it wasn't like a big hill but little hills are still hard 
P05_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0700335-0700871 right and the two bikes we have don't have ge- like you can't change the gears or you can i can't 
P05_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0700945-0702551 and i don't have a backpack so that was another thing was like where am i going to put the groceries once i buy them so i had i had a basket in front so i'd three bags worth of groceries i put one bag in the thing one over my shoulder like with a resuable bag and i stuffed the little things in my purse and zipped it 
P05_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0702551-0704329 so i had like the weight of my purse on my back the weight of this pulling me to the right and then the basket which i'm trying to steer i tried it on the handlebar cuz i saw other people doing it and i'm like okay and my knee hit it every time i came up and the tire hits it so i was like how do the other people do it and i saw a guy with a backpack i'm like okay that's what i gotta get 
P05_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0704581-0704657 hmm 
P05_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0705365-0705787 no we didn't know how to turn lef- 
P05_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0705947-0706407 hmm it's like can we avoid getting lefts and like sure

P05_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0709995-0711739 yeah yeah but you're supposed to be on the right side of the lane so it's a little confusing cuz if you're if there's two lanes going straight or like one going straight one left turn and then over here there's maybe one coming towards you you have to go in this middle lane which is the left turn but you have to be on the right side of it

P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0022902-0023045 we can't see 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0026028-0027826 that he hasn't got a lawyer not a lawyer a doctor who's a brilliant doctor like everyone's recommended for like the field that he's in but he's like a child when it comes to like his organization of life so like to get in touch with him is nearly impossible but 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0028464-0028583 okay 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0029696-0029794 okay 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0030094-0030647 i might have seen that actually okay okay 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0030648-0031680 no i'm just in that i mean for me just cuz i am like myself very very ocd and very like particular i don't like when people don't respond to you 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0031680-0033347 like you know you know what i mean like irregardless of what someone no okay i mean regardless regardless whether it's it's something unimportant to me or important to me like even hales and i were looking at apartments right oh yeah 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0033347-0033469 i said hales and i were looking were looking at apartments and went to look at six of them and 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0033979-0035781 i didn't owe any of them a response but i still will respond to every single one of them and say hey we found something else not interested any more whether it makes a difference to them or not that's just the person i am and if i get if i get a message or an email like i'm so particular i will respond and make sure you know like 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0035801-0037064 we're in discussion about our tiny house right you know but we're delaying it right now so we sent her a message but when we got here now last week i was like hales we haven't updated her in a month let's update her saying that 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0037081-0037546 what's that yeah i don't think you need to just put it on foil if you want 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0037621-0039482 so you know just things like that sorry man i i i went to uh i've been where's my phone it's in my pocket it's in a pocket can you just just read it out to me or right or maybe better i just take it given but um 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0039517-0040764 yeah so that kind of i mean uh her doctor's had four or five days you leave four or five messages with his with his assistant and then 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0040924-0042440 which i think is ridiculous when it's a doctor you know what i mean it's like it's like how do you get in touch with this person luckily he's like you know in a field of medicine where it's usually not an emergency it's not like you're not gonna live or die or you know what i mean it's not life or death usually 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0042440-0043782 but i still think it's sorry uh no no um yes yes i love that i love i love that episode 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0044042-0044252 eight four seventeen 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0045192-0045820 oh no although we're gonna come we're gonna come there yeah let's sit at the table 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0045992-0047434 um no it's fine um i got it and uh no so i didn't get a i didn't get a response which kind of but then we spoke to my aunt 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0047435-0048418 um we spoke to my aunt a few days ago i mean haley spoke to her and she used to do immigration law 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0048469-0049733 um but now she does translation services and refugee services together in in a firm in toronto so yeah 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0050255-0050337 yeah 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0051625-0051775 what they're looking for 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0052777-0052863 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0053111-0053167 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0053719-0053976 that what that's what my 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0054139-0054760 big silver bowl isn't it right behind you in the 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0055041-0055925 i mean anyways i just wanted to have i don't want to go through the whole procedure right now right now it's just 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0056103-0057325 get back to my aunt put us in touch with someone who's an expert on the canadian process cuz we're gonna do our her permanent residence basically 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0057325-0058155 so we're having a chat with her i believe tomorrow or the day after i don't know it's in the calendar yeah 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0060683-0061041 does it affect you though because your other one's still active right 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0061311-0062549 mkay so but it's not it's not like something that's gonna expire in three months before your trying renewal process no for but i mean for us we just i mean for the states it's just a simple question it's it's her sister's wedding is on september thirtieth 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0062553-0064179 so it's can i go or can i not go that's the question so it's not a long drawn out uh complicated thing it's simple can i go can i not go if i do have a return ticket and do say that it's uh you know does it affect anything 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0064249-0065023 so that's the only conversation basically i wanna get across i don't wanna do any other process for the states right now the process i will do right now is for her here 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0065103-0066101 and to get her see here it if she wants to practice as a pt uh she's gotta take the again which i think is 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0066271-0066365 well 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0066512-0068331 yeah it is it is it is hard because of the fact that the last time she wrote the american version of the exam she studied three months for it so i mean it's like it's like uh i mean uh uh writing a gmat or writing you know anything like that when you're in the zone and you you know 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0068353-0069521 even it it depends on how fast you learn and practice two weeks or practice three weeks or at least in the zone so that has to happen one and the second is she specialized in home health so she's been doing home health for the last three years 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0069537-0071377 and this exam does child home tha- so it does all the uh oh athletes all the aspects which she's not even practiced with practiced with in the last three years so things that she'd have to go and refresh basically the entire entity of of of o of her education 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0071409-0072181 uh so it would be re-studying basically so it comes to the question of worth it or not worth it um 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0073897-0074180 you should never have passed 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0074290-0075120 you should never have passed in the first place but that being said that being said the positive part about it 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0075182-0076027 about this this border and this this side versus that side is here it's simpler to things like a pr once she gets a pr she can do whatever she wants 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0076091-0077223 right well on the other side the only way that you can get in apart from your situation where you're married or you have a business x y z or yeah or through marriage yeah 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0077297-0077377 through marriage yeah 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0077707-0079084 so apart from that if you if you wanna do it di- conventionally it's so difficult and it's so restrictive and it's so restrictive to here it's simple here it i i didn't even know this she can come in as common-law 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0079290-0079748 yeah you have to have lived together for twelve months so 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0079880-0080054 she had mentioned but haley had to leave him 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0081858-0082210 would you like me to make the dressing jan i will 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0082384-0083398 what salad is it on the what on the pie it's in the oven already okay 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0083404-0083502 it's in the oven already 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0084058-0084520 no no i'll make it a- i'll make it jan just leave it there i'll make it 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0084634-0085254 uh no i'll do it just where is what but what's in the s- what's in the salad 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0085656-0086074 so just lettuce you're just doing a lettuce salad there's no cheese there's nothing no 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0086418-0087050 okay 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0087500-0088046

P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0097278-0097410 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0097750-0098376 well a the positive thing that the positive thing is we didn't start building 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0098584-0099082 yeah so so for us we were hey we're gonna start building end of the year 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0099170-0099794 oh he can put you in touch we're going to we have a skype with her tomorrow so that's tomorrow jan tomorrow's saturday

P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0100478-0100844 yeah i think i think i might i might need one 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0100904-0101745 like uh yeah so sorry uh but after tomorrow morning we have to skype with her so i mean we and haze were like me and haze were like 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0101803-0102571 why why well i don't know if anyone wants to take on the responsibility of buying it maybe she thinks that that's too long on a it's it's 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0102641-0103259 it is occupied because so there's yeah like an rv park 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0103393-0105269 so so right now the space is divided into this is my my gift to you so the space is divided into a forty sixty or or a thirty five sixty five thirty five is the front the front portion of it and the front portion of it it's twenty four lots 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0105269-0106727 uh all for airbnbs so all tiny houses to airbnbs the back portion which was being built which had only two or three residents was forty lots of what they wanted to be long term sustainable living people 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0106855-0107545 so that was where she was doing the chicken coop and everything sustainable was being built in the back and twenty four lots in the front were full 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0107651-0109251 the forty in the back had only the person who was cleaning the front twenty four lots and someone else there were two three two or three uh and then they were building on to it and uh yeah so it comes with these residents for sure cuz that we've seen physically we've stayed there 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0109277-0111001 um but i don't know why and so we just wrote a a polite uh the earliest we can start building is january because till december we were just 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0111001-0112717 i don't know if they told you so we got another apartment that we're moving to september first it's in the building but much nicer and um we've just signed or committed september first till december twenty second so 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0112795-0114329 depending on what happens between now and then we'll decide whether we're gonna make this place more permanent and look for a twelve month lease or we're gonna go back to the states one of the two but anyways twenty second we're going to chicago cuz that's the first day twenty second is exactly six months 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0114369-0115807 yeah um so well and we go to we go to we go to chicago uh we're there for two days and then twenty fifth we fly to cambodia so we're going to the mekong river cruise 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0115941-0117545 haley and me her sister her sister's husband brother brother's wife mom dad yeah so we're doing the the me- yeah yeah they should you're right they should record that one 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0117757-0118491 ten twelve days yeah hey so how long are we going to oh sorry how how long are we going to cambodia for ten days 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0118665-0119415 two weeks no it's awesome no he said that they they should record that for the experiment 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0119755-0119817 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0119955-0120785 uh and my um my um yeah so we're doing that 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0120785-0122329 and so post that would be the earliest that we could start the build because we wanted to we put it as part of the contract of the build that um that there was uh ten days 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0122338-0124327 one week to ten days where she would involve us in the build so the only cost to her about involving us in the build would be you gotta put us up for ten days because we're gonna stay on your community and uh give me two separate phases of two five day periods so one you'll say this is an important part of the build process and this is another important part of the build process because i said i wanna learn 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0124377-0124535 most importantly i wanna learn 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0124799-0125125 jam no jam was the original one yolk 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0125311-0126279 jam it's on hastings but then like far east on hastings so not hastings which is far east it's not like right here 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0126354-0126939 and um like so two five-day periods i put that in the contract saying that we wanna be involved so 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0127061-0128547 no no we paid two hundred dollars for the drawings that's it but but literally literally we're talking about if this didn't happen if we didn't have to come here would have been well into the build process 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0128575-0129917 like we w- i just told haley this is a huge hu- like she a- she was like sad when she heard that i said that's the happiest news i've heard because that m- that x y z is is is dissolving 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0129955-0131219 uh because be- i mean would have been we'd we had we promised two payments fifty percent up front fifty percent after thirty days we'd be on second payment 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0131519-0131579 sorry 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0131869-0132640 she's her it's her builder her builder building and our we were ordering it from a fabricator who she owned 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0132909-0132998 the bevelling 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0133363-0134426 we we just coincidentally they both went uh hand in hand okay so it was just a coincidence we could have done it separately mind you we could always so 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0134819-0136244 she's a real estate developer and she's she's got a shop on board she's got a shop on board so she's got a like a big space that she's canopied where she builds like or there's you can come in and see other people what they're building 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0138368-0138878 i told you what they were asking for right it was four hundred dollars so it was three fif- yeah 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0139194-0139270 yeah 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0139883-0141878 i i i i i i freeze all the glasses since i stopped drinking booze i have uh cold frosty glasses for juice and i even for coke i put everything in it and i make sure that they're rot- and make sure they're rotated and they're in and they're cold and so the cold ones at the back get front time 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0141878-0142742 and the news ones have to go in the back and she doesn't do that she puts them in the front so then i do that i replace them in the back 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0142870-0143432 yeah jan i'll i'll i'll get up when you guys sit down can can we 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0143914-0143978 yeah 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0144522-0144822 five hundred dollar range that's ridiculous though 
P06_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0144962-0145208 that's that's really high yeah

P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0396980-0397068 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0398006-0398092 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0398289-0399402 but um yeah so she was looking for all this stuff and she gets into these so she got into this ma- she said volunteer so she got into this volunteering zone and she went to every volunteering website in vancouver 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0399448-0400388 and looked up every opportunity and she sent me one saying oh there's this old man at this home you know doesn't speak anything but tamil maybe we should go and visit with him a couple hours a week 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0400461-0401160 and i was like yeah yeah sure yeah i speak tamil urdu arabic a little bit of arabic english 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0401406-0402398 and uh i can get by in all of them yeah i mean i'm not fluent in any of them but i can get by in all of them um um

P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0403326-0403486 so we wrote an email 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0403690-0403782 it's a great story 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0403926-0405134 how much time do we have left so so um she found that was a w- we signed up we gotta go for orie- so basically they wrote us an email back saying that 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0405218-0406092 they basically have to m- rate you in a bit of a so like yeah we gotta go through this check and credit check and then background check and then police report check and then before you can even get enrolled and i'm like 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0406092-0406600 you're really scaring volunteers away with all this crap you know what i mean like 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0406729-0407764 yeah i mean i i i assumed but it was like it was an overwhelming email and then you know he was like oh wait wait we have to go next tuesday for orientation orientation is three and a half hours of orientation before you decide whether you want to sign up 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0407764-0408906 before you decide whether what you wanted whether they'll let you volunteer basically i was like this is a different type of uh different definition of the word 'volunteering' uh uh i wanna help 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0408926-0410442 they're like he doesn't speak any other language but okay so that was one of the things and then she went into a tunnel zone and she found this one ar- one article which read hey wanting to build tiny house uh tiny house-esque community for the homeless and ladies on the street 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0410484-0411132 uh you know what i mean and their kids get in- get involved ladies and children get involved so uh 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0411348-0412904 yeah uh yeah so so i wouldn't say like we don't put we wrote uh haley wrote him and he w- so this is this yeah i thought didn't read the rest of the craigslist post so i didn't know he was a nutbag and he called her back and she gave him her number 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0412934-0413786 and he's like oh yes i'm waiting uh they're not letting me build it so do you want to come with me and ask for land and permission to build it 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0413788-0415250 and he he first few minutes i was like from the first thirty seconds of the conversation i'm like haley this guy is not okay you know what i mean and he's like yeah yeah i went i'm just going to ask ubc for the land and i'm going to build and i'm going to ask them to pay me because they should pay me i'm like haley this guy's nuts 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0415250-0415610 just hang up the phone and she's already given him her number on craigslist 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0415649-0416580 and i like jericho beach sounds like haley no more i was like no more tunnel vision 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0416630-0417072 yeah i was like no more tunnel vision stop writing random

P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0417881-0419614 yeah and then and he's telling haley you know a lot of people contacted me because really if you read the post it reads well and then they all just seem to be flaking and i'm like because you're a nutbag and you haven't started anything you know what i mean if he actually had a established project we're willing to come out and give you eight hours or ten hours a week and come out and build 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0419672-0420164 yep hi mama hi 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0420374-0420468 so

P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0444269-0444805 no and i think plate it's quite plate it's quate is one of the plate plate is one of the successful ones boo 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0444977-0445059 yeah 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0445181-0445289 hello fresh 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0445659-0445757 boxed i think 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0446323-0446419 it's possible 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0446863-0447035 i don't think the dog one was successful 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0449479-0449587 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0449837-0449951 and it's one of the 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0450033-0450085 with 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0450159-0450267 what tricks 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0450373-0450425 hmm 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0450967-0451221 so did you cook or was that they sent you the food 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0451311-0451567 oh i thought you were talking about boxed foods still 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0451851-0452103 and s- and your style and they'll send you like 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0452691-0452787 that's so cool 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0453569-0454773 i saw that i mean i saw the guys on shark tank that wanted to do something similar to that and there was once there was anoth- there was another set of guys uh which i think was a fail they didn't get picked up 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0454781-0456407 the was interesting it was like travel with no luggage so tell us the destination you're traveling to and we'll send you a box to where you're going with like a t-shirt and yeah yeah yeah single use items no you can decide they're reusable you can either keep them or return them 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0456497-0457421 y- yeah and after you've worn them so it was like re-wear yeah and then you know that was like the hitch w- that was the hitch that they didn't like so much 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0457553-0458851 yeah uh but uh there's probably something with like underwear but like shirt and suit and things like that so you don't have to carry your luggage you go there and you're like oh i want a black suit this is the size this is and everything will be ready for you at the hotel room so you don't have to travel with anything 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0458851-0459817 but in today's world where traveling is like so much or the world's so much smaller and it's so easy to get from a to b and also you know you can carry a lot more i think even 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0459883-0460377 and lots of places check baggages for you also so you know you're not really saving money on that 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0460827-0460979 yeah it's a big it's a big th- 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0461113-0461295 it's not it's creating the problem and then the solution 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0462373-0462553 b- but sorry 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0465397-0466009 that's a brilliant i mean what you said there's like so true so brilliant it's like 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0466055-0467783 it's come to a point of saturation to the fact that if you're not a tech company or you're you're not a tech start-up or if you're not in the tech world in the conventional world they are just creating the problem and solving it you know what i mean they were they were looking to that that other guy who made a pitch was was that 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0467783-0469611 you were talking about the was the dog health food so it was like a it was basically healthy vege- so like food like not like a blue apron but like meals delivered you don't have to make they're made they're ready and they come in a nice box and there's no preservatives no additive yeah 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0469735-0470099 yeah yeah instead of giving your dog and it was like only six dollars a day something like that 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0470221-0470323 hmm 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0470527-0470789 that's what you do with a dog 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0471091-0471157 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0471493-0471545 hmm 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0471675-0471981 we don't have a cat and yet i feed now i have to feed this cat 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0472181-0472423 it's already been three days and i've forgotten to feed the dog 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0472619-0472891 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0473147-0473207 hmm 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0473387-0473451 yeah 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0473499-0474217 and then you're talking about opening dog food and and feeding the dog when i grew up as a kid we used to feed the dog in the house our food 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0474217-0474803 so dog would eat like if we had we had rice and meat like leftover rice and meat would be what the dog ate like at least 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0474888-0475763 you know it's then it was normal like people go oh no there's salt in that or there's oil in that i'm like it's a dog for god's sake they eat out of a garbage if they're they're you know now they're like oh this will kill them that will kill them 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0475763-0476147 and i was like our dog lived till he was lived till she was twenty three 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0476329-0477387 twenty three yeah probably the best thing is not the best thing but in two thousand fourteen so she died in in twenty fifteen in twenty fourteen she died 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0477387-0478265 and took her to give up give her body up at the vet so they have a section where you go and you give them and they'll do all the services they do like a doggie and she woke up on the bed 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0478317-0479489 yeah she woke up on the yeah she woke up on the so we thought that she was dead my cuz and then she came back and lived for another year 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0479669-0479985 she lived for another year yeah her name was armani yeah 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0480039-0480141 armani 
P06_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0480411-0481469 and i mean yeah so i mean she lived twenty three years nineteen ninety three no it's like nineteen ninety two dubai yeah

P06_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0704910-0706726 and you know like we just made all like we had just had to take three right turns everywhere cuz we didn't want to turn left at any signal right turns so then we stopped at a coffee we stopped at a coffee shop we actually did this which had the best carrot cake 
P06_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0706726-0706930 uh what was it called 
P06_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0706960-0708382 uh yeah we st- wu- on uh the nice part of hastings and we stopped at this coffee shop and we googled how do you make a left turn on a bike and it gave you all the options get off the bike and cross the street that was like option so there was like four different ways 
P06_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0708538-0709082 you idiot cross the street so that that that would be- 
P06_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0709144-0710006 yeah crosswalk and then you don't have to take the left or that's the official how you veer off and how you this but i didn't know what to do when there was a bi- when there was a bus 
P06_S02_U05_LIVING.ENH-0712088-0712764 and you have to go from the right side of that lane to the right lane on the right side of the right lane when you come back off so

P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0127547-0127615 oh 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0128273-0128335 right 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0128523-0128597 hmm 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0130079-0130301 cuz now you're not on the hook anymore tha- 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0130721-0130797 yeah 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0130943-0131501 so wait so so so so is the community actually building getting the homes built 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0131537-0132013 like uh like wh- what is the relationship between the home builder and and this community 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0132089-0132541 oh i thought you were like ordering this thing from a yeah yeah 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0132666-0133410 oh okay i understand now okay that makes sense see i thought there was like a lot rig component and then there was like you interfacing with her 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0133775-0133973 i understand okay now i understand 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0134089-0134159 hmm 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0134419-0135283 that's brilliant for her actually that's a great business model cuz then she's essentially like a real estate developer but but but that she gets she gets the lot rent forever 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0135389-0135511 oh okay 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0135572-0135683 hmm 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0135759-0136105 yeah yeah that's s- so good it's like 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0136223-0138132 the the biggest the the the biggest like trick involved in that is the fact that she's building homes but they're not they're not taxed as homes like they're taxed as chattel and then because of that they're not attached to the land and because of that she still owns the land and retains ownership of it and then can just charge lot rent forever and lot rent in austin is very expensive 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0138132-0138394 you know as you know you know 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0138710-0139254 per month that's that's pretty cheap for austin like uh i've seen i've seen trip- 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0142583-0142753 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0143255-0143349 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0143995-0144541 i've seen i've seen lot rent for for mobile home parks in in the five hundred dollar range in austin like not even in austin 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0144645-0145389 yeah like not even um what that's really high that's like double the national average yeah 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0145711-0146693 three hundred two hundred no way nah that that'd be real cheap um for for for like ru- ru- like nowheresville rural america 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0146747-0148479 maybe would be in the low two hundreds like r- i'm talking like b f e arkansas you know like not not even near a big city um you know if you're close to a big city you're probably in the high three hundreds range um or e- even a moderate sized town that has an employment base probably moderate to high three hundreds 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0148521-0149183 um my my park in oklahoma ha- we charged three ten for a for a waterfront site but that's waterfront that's kinda different 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0149403-0150005 utilities included that's because that's because we were on a well so so water doesn't cost us anything so we just include it 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0150077-0150435 um no they s- pay separate for that yep you know 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0151275-0151351 hmm 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0151683-0153537 yeah so so she's probably she's kind of saying well so i've got this smaller piece of property i'm gonna slice and dice it up into uh tiny tiny lots which car- can accommodate tiny homes which are much smaller than like a normal mobile home lot and i i'm gonna charge essentially the same as what a normal mobile home park would charge for lot rent except that the lots are much smaller 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0153575-0153699 and because it's awesome 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0153997-0154059 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0154859-0154913 hmm

P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0198756-0200173 no i do the same for the the billing of our home every every expense i put and i like i have a i have i've created a whole bunch of like chart of accounts because i use an accounting system for it and i so i've got like i categorize every expense i decide whether it's capital or whether it's opex 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0200173-0201737 and like so mortgage is opex but like like operating expense so i i treat my i treat our home as if it's a as if it's an operating business so when when i get like a bill from the architect that's i sort of consider that capital because i'm like improving the value of the land 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0201737-0203166 by paying the architect to design the home which is eventually gonna improve the value so so i like put the architecture uh invoice and call that like capital you know like ca- i guess capital contributions from myself 
P07_S02_U02_KITCHEN.ENH-0203215-0204117 yeah whereas if i get like a mortgage statement or a gas bill or an electricity bill i consider well that's not really adding value to the property that's not a capital expense that's just an operating expense so i put that in as well

P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0312873-0312971 thanks for having us 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0313289-0313633 yeah i love food 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0313809-0314137 yeah of all time 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0315155-0315303 hmm 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0317313-0318461 well it it somebody told me about it at work and they're like if you're bored you should do this and it was like a you know yeah it was exactly like you described you're bored at work and you just want a distraction so you do that 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0318535-0319609 but then you know they they did they did uh narrow it down by city so you could like filter it by city so if you live in new york you would only see you would only see people that were from new york city 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0319651-0320327 and then i guess the the genius thought well why don't we just allow people to meet other people and maybe we can make some revenue from this and they did 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0320393-0321821 but the reason i the reason i went on it was cuz i had tried uh online dating and um you know in new york online dating is great cuz you there's a lot of people there so you tend to line up a lot of dates pretty fast 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0321821-0322943 yeah so so i went on i went on match and i would and i would like literally line upm like three or four dates a week with different people on matchcom but the trouble with matchcom 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0322943-0323749 is that everybody writes a fucking novel about themselves and nobody is self-aware enough to rea- to for the novel to be of any use right so 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0323749-0325529 everybody on matchcom you know thinks that that they know themselves e- e- every single person on matchcom is like i love i love red wine well not everybody in life loves red wine but everybody on match loves red wine because they love the s- the you really like they really like the s- right they love the self image of somebody who loves red wine seems sophisticated 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0325529-0326693 so everybody's like i love red wine and then you know cuz it there's like a form you fill out right it's like do you love x do you love y and so so everybody r- everybody says yes i love this to the things that sound good 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0326719-0328161 like so half so like half the people on matchcom are like i love skinny dipping i was like you've never been you've never been skinny dipping you know like yeah i like the idea of skinny dipping but i've never gone skinny dipping except in college i guess i did once but like 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0328161-0328769 but like n- so people end up writing m- making up these fabrications about themselves that have nothing to do with their personalities 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0328815-0328969 right and yeah 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0329036-0329287 yeah it's like sounds but if you're in the frame of m- 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0329593-0330541 no but they they do that too but i mean the thing is i think if you're in the frame of mind where you're sitting on your laptop late at night thinking okay i gotta write a profile here and you write four paragraphs about yourself 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0330593-0331081 it ne- it almost never ends up being a real true reflection of who you are as a person 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0333687-0333805 hmm right 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0334119-0334741 right exactly it's like your your ideal best self that you wanna be pursuing so 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0334826-0336035 right right right right yeah i'm quirky i i say offb- offball oddball off beat things and okay maybe you did that once last week it's not like it's not how it's supposed to be so 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0336063-0337517 but the thing is on match if you have a date lined up you can't not read the whole profile right you have to show up like having done your research you have to show up with the with the back with the official back story memorized right so so i found that it's it was very time consuming you go on four or five dates a week 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0337542-0339184 with different people you've gotta memorize all these stupid f- fictitious backstories it's retarded so anyway so that's why i did hot or not because all you get is like one line and a photo so you can't really lie very much you say one thing that's witty and you have a photo and like that's sort of true information so 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0340965-0341001 
P07_S02_U03_DINING.ENH-0342054-0342092 hmm

P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0193196-0194300 well with eggs you've already got the shell so you don't even need to put it in a bell but sous vide is like when you take meat and you put it in like plastic and you cook it in water which circulates but it's at a certain temperature so it cooks it 
P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0194300-0194562 she's a she's a phenomenal cook 
P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0194562-0194762 so yeah so she made

P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0194962-0196868 um so she uh yeah so she made the eggs but then she made like this kinda japanesey rice where she like i was kinda like nervous when she was making it because i'm like oh my god you're putting seaweed in there and you're putting like like uh worces- or uh soy sauce and some other weird stuff and i'm like okay whatever i'm like but i trust you 
P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0196868-0197173 i'm like i'm trying to not be a big baby or whatever 
P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0197173-0198083 um and and she cooked like these yams with like that she like put cinnamon in it and then she cooked salmon 
P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0198083-0198858 and so she cooked it so like you didn't have to cook the top but because i am a big baby i'm like can you flip the salmon for me like just just just sear it a little 
P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0198858-0199213 and uh so she did that and it was so tasty 
P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0199213-0200028 oh and then she just like sliced the egg in half so it's like you know like a ramen egg or whatever and then it was just like a perfect like egg 
P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0200028-0200228 oh my god no she does insane things 
P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0200228-0200468 yeah like she'll make like desserts and stuff

P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0204003-0204293 and then we just well then we just started liking each other 
P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0204358-0204838 and we're like oh i like you as a person or whatever and i'm like well this is weird like i'm starting to develop feelings 
P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0204838-0205748 yeah and i like i really like her as a friend and like we just we're very similar like turned out we both grew up in white rock and like it's just so bizarre 
P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0205748-0206178 like both our parents one of our parents like both work for the airline like it was just weird 
P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0206178-0206378 and we're super comfortable 
P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0208833-0209418 um yeah but like like she's so fun but i'm like but she smokes and like she drinks

P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0210268-0210413 the thing is you know when you know 
P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0210928-0211413 like we laugh so much but i think she parties a little too much and i just don't 
P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0211413-0211713 no no no just alcohol like 
P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0211713-0212483 they're all like thir- well uh the cook is like twenty seven twenty eight and the other ones are thirty thirty one

P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0212723-0213248 yeah so that's the thing once you're thirty and you still party you're gonna probably be a partier for life 
P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0217647-0217782 she'll talk to anybody 
P25_S09_U01_KITCHEN.ENH-0217782-0217907 australian

P26_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0373866-0375302 my thesis advisor my thesis advisor had a good argument where she was like a good reason cuz we were talking about like other academics and how they get so weird cuz they're on their own all the time and they get very extreme and she was like 
P26_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0375309-0376457 one of the things that's really good about having like a partner in your life or having somebody in your life all the time or having kids is like it allows you it stops you from becoming too extreme in any direction 
P26_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0376457-0377200 so it's like you can't give into your weird extremities like the way you can when you're just on your own and become like a total

P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0320812-0321132 like i just i just never seen anything like it 
P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0321258-0321702 there's a lesson in this but i don't know what it is 
P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0321702-0321924 and i still don't know if i believe in past lives 
P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0321924-0322182 this guy was like arguing after like

P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0327944-0328352 the older souls will like be like okay i didn't learn this lesson i need to keep going 
P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0330306-0330366 yeah

P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0334534-0334894 well someone asked like why would people choose to go to ethiopia 
P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0334894-0335392 and he answered he was like the first thing you need to know as a new soul is survival 
P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0335392-0335592 and that's where you learn survival 
P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0335592-0335820 and sy- syria that's where you learn survival 
P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0335820-0336651 and then you progress and like people that are really old souls are like really advanced always end up in europe or the parts of canada and the us 
P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0336679-0336764 yeah 
P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0337106-0337172 you're right

P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0338838-0340505 right and he was so when they went and talked to her guide or whatever cuz she had spirit guides or whatever they were like because you saw your mother murdered in a last life and you're like how can my eyes see that and as a even a higher evolved soul how can i even commence 
P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0340515-0341336 to dissolve that into love to see that as love and so let's take your vision away in your next life so you can actually understand what love is 
P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0341336-0341482 people caring for you 
P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0341482-0341738 so every life you actually learn a lesson 
P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0341738-0341982 that's what this talk was it was very interesting 
P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0342340-0344030 well they say you choose people like i chose julia to be my friend i chose you to be my friend you like we have our circle of souls and like even my brother who passed away like maybe i he's like i love you so much i'm gonna pass away at this age so you can learn how to really love yourself and love your friends you know 
P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0344030-0345156 that's what they say is like it's the highest form of love to lose someone cuz they were like i will t- even like lovers i will hurt you to the highest degree because i love you so much and in the next life maybe we'll be together or whatever 
P27_S09_U04_DINING.ENH-0346164-0346266 so you know

P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0548333-0548533 if you feel torn don't do it 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0548701-0548789 hmm 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0549731-0549923 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0550101-0550339 yeah no and that's totally 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0550339-0550439 i don't care 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0550439-0551817 that's the thing like i just would like to revel in the fact that he bought me a ring and that's totally amazing like cuz i know it wasn't cheap right 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0551817-0552127 i chose it we saw the price tag 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0553075-0553228 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0553228-0553594 i've seen stripper no it's that i'm 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0553748-0553824 i just 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0553920-0554518 if if if if we're gonna have a get together and people wanna celebrate and stuff like that then i'm totally fine with that 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0554518-0554712 i just don't want it to be like 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0554796-0555548 and i don't want anyone to financially bankrupt themselves you know what i mean 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0555548-0556626 like i feel like this wedding business can just get way too out of hand and i think because the expectations are way too high 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0556626-0556860 i don't have any expectations 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0556904-0557860 i have a ring that i never thought in a million years that i would ever get cuz i'm not into diamonds so 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0558352-0558460 no 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0558538-0559916 no cuz i always based it on like the stereotypical like the the the bride and the groom walk down the church aisle and so that's like what i have all my experiences to base it on and the thing is is like 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0559921-0561043 like when he asked me he's like what kind of ring do you want and we'd go online and i looked and i thought i knew until we went into a store and then i tried them on and and i was like well now it's totally different 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0561103-0561445 so now i feel like it's totally different 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0561561-0563369 where i think maybe once upon a time i would have said well yeah in a church with all the flowers and friends and family but now that it comes down to it's actually happening just like the ring was actually happening and i had to choose it was totally different from what i originally thought 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0563384-0563981 i think now that it comes down to it actually happening i don't want to 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0563981-0564827 one i know my father and my mother aren't contributing financially so one i absolutely do not want to fi- financially hinder anyone cuz 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0564897-0564986 who 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0565112-0565228 yeah they know 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0565272-0565586 and no one's really congratulated me 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0565586-0566522 so and it doesn't break my heart cuz i i know my family i know my family so i think that maybe his family doesn't know my family 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0566522-0566744 um normal 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0566880-0567028 absolutely 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0567294-0567352 yeah 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0567384-0568190 so now that it comes down to well we're actually gonna get married i just don't want anyone to break the bank 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0568190-0568480 and i don't think anyone should have to break the bank 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0568480-0569394 and i think that we can celebrate without doing that and without like this huge thing 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0571581-0571665 yeah 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0571717-0571817 yeah 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0572003-0572083 yeah 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0572183-0573878 yeah that's that's what like my new kind of girl dream of what a wedding should be because the last thing i want is fi- cuz even when i went home to montreal and to the townships and everyone was like oh my god you're engaged and when's the wedding 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0573878-0574350 they wanted a date and i didn't want a date and i said well isn't this enough 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0574350-0575368 like is this not enough and why is this not enough i didn't understand it and so i would cut the conversation short 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0575393-0576371 only to come home and the conversation was just not allowed to be cut short unfortunately so yeah 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0577847-0578639 but what a lot of people have asked me they're like well cuz women wear the engagement ring even though i'm not wearing a ring now but women wear the engagement ring 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0578753-0579203 men yeah men don't have an engagement ring so i was like zach 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0579203-0580235 s- that's the one thing that i'm s- a bit slighted about i'm like so i'm now marked as a taken woman 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0580273-0580413 you're not 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0581785-0582287 that's why i was asking zach if he would take mine good good c- continue i'm so excited 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0583129-0583201 yeah 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0583381-0583667 no i said you should be wearing a ring 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0583667-0583855 i'm i'm marked 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0583983-0584381 no but that's why i'm like i think i need to buy him his wedding band 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0584645-0584697 yeah 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0584753-0584861 what 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0586367-0586431 hmm 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0587245-0587317 hmm

P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0596405-0596647 but then everyone can ask 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0596647-0596839 how did she propose

P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0598867-0600793 cuz when he proposed to me when we were in harrison hot springs and we were talking over dinner about like the whole plans what didn't happen what ended up happening and then through all that i don't know why i came up with my own scenario and it was in bed you're tied up and 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0601529-0601761 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0602317-0602607

P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0671933-0672325 i was taking physics calculus yeah hmm 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0672427-0672503 hmm 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0672879-0672959 hmm hmm 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0672985-0673109 i've heard 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0673235-0673381 i've heard it's fucked

P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0675679-0676085 that makes me happy cuz i haven't i haven't studied space stuff 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0676085-0676347 it's not part of the biology requirement unfortunately 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0676503-0676589 yeah 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0677095-0677185 yeah

P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0678799-0680321 yeah no cuz i had a kid that i was working with he was taking teacher's math at sfu and uh we were chatting about it and he told me he's like it's the hardest thing i've ever done because 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0680321-0681069 is it true is it true you actually don't compute numbers it's just really formulas and algorithms and stuff 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0682135-0683271 and that's the thing like i've gotten by with math and especially calculus based on not really understanding how it works and just working it through 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0683427-0683537 oh okay 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0683795-0683931 yeah okay

P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0687551-0688441 yeah cuz i know like a lotta the teachers that i've met they say there's not enough female science math teachers 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0688441-0689065 there's not enough um oh my god what's the word 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0689407-0689913 no role models for fro kids in high school who who are female

P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0694219-0695329 her mom passed away and i went back to spend a week with her and um it was like a simple math problem like really simple math and it's 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0695329-0695697 i'm not even embarrassed by it it's just like wh- who i am 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0695703-0696947 it was like subtracting really simple numbers and i i did this and she slapped me on my arm cuz she's really good at math and i was always really bad at math 
P28_S09_U06_LIVING.ENH-0697011-0697911 and she looked at me she's like i don't even let my kids count on their fingers anymore and i was like just let me be
